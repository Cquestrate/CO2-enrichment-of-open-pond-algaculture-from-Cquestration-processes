# CO2-enrichment-of-open-pond-algaculture-from-Cquestration-processes
Cquestrate would generate CO2 emissions while sequestering more CO2 than it emits, in the oceans.
A further optimization could be to enrich water used for algaculture, from these CO2 emissions,
after all heat energy has been economically extracted from the CO2.
With a high enough price on GHG emissions, this may help make open-pond algaculture economical

The Aquatic Species Program concluded with a negative result: biofuel production from open-pond
algaculture was unlikely to become economical except at much higher prices for fuel. If carbon
prices increase (particularly to the high levels required for the global economy to start
moving carbon-negative), the economics of open-pond algaculture for biofuel may improve
significantly. Cquestrate would be CO2-positive on land, but net out carbon negative after
the effects of absorbing CO2 on oceans from the lime it would produce. The Cquestrate CSP
project proposes liberating that CO2 on land through solar heating. This CO2 could go to enrich
the waters of an open-pond algaculture plantation, yielding some carbon-neutral fuel value.

This repo is to contain simulation models for assessing whether the idea is economical, at
various GHG sequestration price levels.
